### US-001: Project setup and dependencies
Status: in_progress
Depends on: None

Description:
As a developer, I want a properly configured Node.js project so I can build the API with modern tooling.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Initialize package.json with type set to "module"
- [ ] Install runtime dependencies: express, better-sqlite3, zod, uuid (include npm install command)
- [ ] Install dev dependencies: vitest, supertest (include npm install -D command)
- [ ] Create src/ directory structure for app, routes, and db modules
- [ ] Add npm scripts: start, dev, test
- [ ] Add .gitignore entries for node_modules and *.db
- [ ] Example: npm test runs and exits successfully even if no tests exist yet
- [ ] Negative case: attempting to run npm test before installing dev dependencies fails with missing module error
